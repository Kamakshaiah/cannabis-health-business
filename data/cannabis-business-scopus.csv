This paper provides a systematic analysis of the current licensing strategies taken by all states that have passed medical cannabis laws (MCLs)/recreational cannabis laws (RCLs). We construct comprehensive data on cannabis business licenses offered in each state, as well as metrics for license categories, cost, and issuance volume. We then analyze patterns between these metrics, also considering how long ago states implemented MCLs/RCLs, qualitative licensing aspects, state ideology and voting preference, and state cannabis taxation data. We observe that states tend to license medical cannabis more restrictively than adult-use cannabis: i.e., by offering licenses in fewer categories, at higher cost, in lower issuance volume, and more often mandating vertical integration. Additionally, states that implemented MCLs/RCLs earlier tend to offer licenses in more categories, at lower cost, and in greater volumes. Further, though states that implemented MCLs recently lean conservative and Republican, we do not observe clear relationships between ideology or voting preference and licensing policy. In our supporting results, we observe that a greater share of states with complex licensing structures impose non-retail price cannabis taxes than states overall, and we discuss how states have changed their licensing policies over time. © 2022","Adult-use cannabis; Cannabis legalization; Licensing; Medical cannabis; Rationing","Adult; Analgesics; Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists; Cannabis; Hallucinogens; Humans; Legislation, Drug; Marijuana Smoking; Medical Marijuana; United States; cannabis; analgesic agent; cannabinoid receptor agonist; medical cannabis; psychedelic agent; ambulatory care; Article; commercial phenomena; cost; entrepreneurship; fiscal policy; health care cost; human; legal aspect; licensing; management; public health; tax; adult; cannabis smoking; drug legislation; United States","Elsevier B.V."

Legislators, licensees, and even LCB staff have derided the LCB's preference for enforcement before education and its reliance on traditional policing systems developed during the War on Drugs to regulate the cannabis industry. The LCB's frequently hostile enforcement culture-including arguing to courts that cannabis licensees have no constitutional rights-has repeatedly converted de minimis regulatory violations into business-ending events. The LCB's conduct prompted the legislature to pass a sweeping reform bill, and a subsequently issued independent audit requested by the LCB recognized the need for and recommended additional widespread reform, some of which the LCB implemented. Nevertheless, the LCB has not yet shown it has evolved into an agency that prioritizes achieving regulatory compliance over punishing licensees. This Article, the first of its kind to chronicle the regulatory and legislative evolution of Washington's cannabis industry, details the troubling history of the LCB's abuses of power and policy blunders in the early years of regulating Washington's cannabis industry. Washington presents a cautionary tale for other jurisdictions to heed when crafting or amending the regulatory scheme for their adult use cannabis industries. Stakeholders that are looking for a responsible and fair approach to regulating cannabis should consider the history, limitations, concerns, and resulting reforms borne from the Washington system. © 2021 Cornell Law School.

Localities are an important focus because in many states with legalized cannabis, local jurisdictions have authority to prevent or condition its cultivation, sale, and use. Opportunities potentially flowing to localities from legalization include increased tax revenues and land values, business expansion, and increased employment; public health and safety benefits; and the potential for legalization to advance social and racial inclusion. Challenges include the possibility that economic benefits will be more limited than anticipated; complex regulatory environments facing local governments and cannabis businesses, possible increases in pollution, blight, and public health and safety concerns; and less advancement of social and racial equity than hoped by advocates.

Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to explore the demographic correlates of alcohol and psychoactive drug use. Of the total participants (N = 390), 64.4% and 33.3% reported lifetime (ever used) and past-year use of alcohol, respectively, but the prevalence of risky alcohol use was 18.5%. After adjusting for relevant covariates, only male sex, younger age, and rural residence remained significantly associated with risky alcohol use. The prevalence of ever-use and past-year use of psychoactive substances was 39.7% and 17.4%, respectively. The most common substance ever used was cannabis (37.4%).

It further sheds light on how the USA’ aggressive extraterritorial approach to anti-money laundering (AML) enforcement might simultaneously suppress the banking of cannabis-related businesses in Jamaica due to the lingering fear of de-risking. Design/methodology/approach: An international and comparative legal and policy analysis was conducted of the nexus among shifting drug enforcement policies, AML laws and the banking of cannabis-related businesses. Findings: This study found that the constitutional relationship between the US federal government and states has created a de facto comparative advantage for the US medical cannabis-related businesses that benefit from limited access to financial services. This was found to pose far-reaching implications for the banking and development of the Jamaican cannabis sector due to the dependence of the country’s financial institutions on correspondent banking relationships with the US banks that are regulated by federal AML statutes.

Furthermore, federal regulations disincentivize financial institutions from banking and lending to licensed cannabis businesses. The authors explore the impact of legal cannabis business activity on California financial institutions, the barriers to banking faced by cannabis businesses, and the nontraditional sources of financing used by the industry. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a mixed methods approach. The authors utilize call data for banks and credit unions headquartered in California and state cannabis licensing data to estimate the impact of the extensive and intensive margins of licensed cannabis activity on key banking indicators using difference-and-difference and fixed effects regressions. The qualitative data come from interviews with industry stakeholders in northern California's “Emerald Triangle” and add important context. Findings: The quantitative results show economically and statistically significant impacts of licensed cannabis activity on banking indicators, suggesting both direct and spillover effects from cannabis activity to the financial sector. However, cannabis businesses report substantial barriers to accessing basic financial services and credit, leading to nontraditional financing arrangements. Practical implications: The results suggest opportunities for cannabis businesses and financial institutions if regulations are eased and important avenues for further study.

Nevertheless, since 1990, dozens of countries have authorized the licensed growth and processing of “industrial hemp” (cultivars with quite low levels of THC). Canada has concentrated on hemp oilseed production, and very recently, Europe changed its emphasis from fiber to oilseed. The USA, historically a major hemp producer, appears on the verge of reintroducing industrial hemp production. This presentation provides updates on various agricultural, scientific, social, and political considerations that impact the commercial hemp industry in the United States and Canada. The most promising scenario for the hemp industry in North America is a continuing focus on oilseed production, as well as cannabidiol (CBD), the principal non-intoxicant cannabinoid considered by many to have substantial medical potential, and currently in great demand as a pharmaceutical. Future success of the industrial hemp industry in North America is heavily dependent on the breeding of more productive oilseed cultivars, the continued development of consumer goods, reasonable but not overly restrictive regulations, and discouragement of overproduction associated with unrealistic enthusiasm. Changing attitudes have generated an unprecedented demand for the cannabis plant and its products, resulting in urgent needs for new legislative, regulatory, and business frameworks, as well as scientific, technological, and agricultural research. © 2016 by the authors","Cannabis; Environmental sustainability; Fiber; Hemp; Marijuana; Oilseed","","MDPI AG"

Many local cannabis businesses have attracted investment from overseas, including from Canada, US and Europe. Aim: To explore the opportunities and risks of foreign investment in an emerging domestic legal cannabis market in a developing country. Methods: Thematic analysis of semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 22 key informants (KIs) from the Jamaican government, local cannabis industry, academia and civil society, and field observations of legal and illegal cannabis cultivators. Results: KIs from the Jamaican public agencies and domestic cannabis entrepreneurs saw foreign investment as an essential source of capital to finance the start-up costs of legal cannabis businesses. Local cannabis entrepreneurs prioritised investors with the greatest financial resources, brand reputation and export networks. They also considered how allied an investor was with their business vision (e.g., organic cultivation, medical vs. recreational). The key benefits of partnering with a foreign investor included transfer of technical knowledge and financial capital, which enhanced production, quality assurance and seed-to-sale tracking. Some KIs expressed concern over investors’ focus on increasing production efficiency and scale at the expense of funding research and development (R&D) and clinical trials. KIs from the local industry, government agencies and civil society highlighted the risks of ‘predatory’ shareholder agreements and domestic political interference. Concerns were raised about the impact of foreign investment on the diversity of the domestic cannabis sector in Jamaica, including the commitment to transition traditional illegal small-scale cannabis cultivators to the legal sector. Conclusion: While foreign investment has facilitated the commercialisation of the cannabis sector in Jamaica, regulatory measures are also needed to protect the domestic industry and support the transition of small-scale illegal cultivators to the legal regime. Foreign investments may alter the economic, social and political determinants of health in transitioning from illegal to legal cannabis market economy. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cannabis; Cannabis industry; Caribbean; Jamaica; Legalisation; Medical cannabis; Policy","Cannabis; Government Agencies; Humans; Investments; Jamaica; Medical Marijuana; Canada; Europe; Jamaica; United States; Cannabis; medical cannabis; cannabis; cultivar; developing world; foreign direct investment; foreign policy; legislation; local government; medicinal plant; policy implementation; stakeholder; Article; cannabis use; developing country; finance; funding; government; investment; Jamaica; legal aspect; marketing; population research; priority journal; public health; semi structured interview; human; investment","BioMed Central Ltd"

This article argues that regulators’ entrepreneurial regulatory legal strategies can have a material impact on regulated entities and give them a competitive advantage. To demonstrate, this article claims that regulators’ adoption of permissive regulatory legal strategies has facilitated access of some cannabis-related businesses to the banking system. Conversely, if regulators adopted obstructive regulatory strategies, this would act as a constraint on such access in the future, even if Congress resolves the federalism issue largely responsible for the current limitations these businesses face. © 2021 The Author.

Despite its intentions, the regulatory framework remains ambiguous. Food businesses, with their constant search for growth, are considering launching several food products with cannabis as an ingredient, once the drug is legalized. This study does not look at the health effects of cannabis per se, but rather consumers’ perception of cannabis as a food ingredient through the lens of food innovation, if it were to be legalized. It explores several dimensions, including cannabis-infused food products sold in grocery stores and dishes served at restaurants. It evaluates potential times when consumers would consume these products, in addition to their preferred food products. The survey also looks at perceived risks related to specific demographics such as children and pregnant women. The survey assesses both perceived risks and anticipated behaviour in a market in which a former illicit product becomes readily available. The results show that Canadians, although mostly favourable to cannabis's legalization and willing to try cannabis-infused food products, are concerned about health risks the drug represents, especially for young children. Results also suggest that most Canadians do not feel knowledgeable enough to cook with cannabis at home, which opens an opportunity for leaders in the industry.

However, cannabis remains a Schedule 1 drug under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Sections 801 through 812), leaving federal law in conflict with the laws of over half of the states. As a result, market participants in legal cannabis businesses face risks due to the industry's unique legal status within the United States. We examine the risks and challenges deemed by the cannabis industry as the top risks facing the industry's continued future growth and its sustainability. In addition to general risks inherent in a nascent industry, a legal cannabis business faces additional risks, such as risks in its banking and finance activity, placement of insurance, payment of taxes, and managing its supply chain. These legal businesses also face true legal risk from the possibility of being shut down by the federal government and seizure of assets and product under the CSA.

First, national illegal drug-use self-reported survey data is compared with national laboratory drug testing results, illustrating a number of inconsistencies. During the 17-year period (1988-2004) the number of laboratory positive test results has decreased by 66% while during the same period self-reported drug-use has increased by 30%. The lack of concurrence between lab results and self-report surveys are examined in light of the typical panel of drugs being tested in U.S. laboratories, the increased specificity of immunoassay screening tests, and the critical issues of adulteration and substitution. Second, a brief review of the state-of-the-science in rapid point-of-collection (POCT) oral fluid drug-testing devices is presented along with some device evaluation findings. In general the window of drug detection in oral fluid is measured in hours. Most of the available oral fluid POCT devices can detect methamphetamine and amphetamines and opiates very well. The ability to detect cocaine appears to vary significantly across devices, while the ability to detect cannabis use is generally poor across all devices. Finally, efforts to reach out and assist small businesses in the development of workplace anti-drug programs are discussed in the context of increasing workplace programs in the European Union. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Despite increasing legality and growing social tolerance, the actual status of cannabis remains controversial. Large segments of the population and local authorities remain uncomfortable with the use of cannabis and resist allowing cannabis facilities in their communities. I employ statistical analysis to understand why some jurisdictions move toward more permissive cannabis policies and others do not. The results show that, on average, socially and economically prosperous cities express higher support for cannabis legalization, but cannabis businesses are more likely to receive permits in cities that are socially and economically distressed. The disparity between demand (white middle-class communities) and supply (poor Hispanic communities) demonstrates that stereotypes generated by the war on drugs have not disappeared after the passage of new cannabis laws and continue to perpetuate the marginalization of disadvantaged individuals and places.  © The Author(s), 2023.

However, the plant is also extremely useful as a source of stem fiber, edible seed oil, and medicinal compounds, all of which are undergoing extremely promising research, technological applications, and business investment. Indeed, despite its capacity for harm as a recreational drug, cannabis has phenomenal potential for providing new products to benefit society and for generating extensive employment and huge profits. Misguided policies, until recently, have prevented legitimate research on the beneficial properties of cannabis, but there is now an explosion of societal, scientific, and political support to reappraise and remove some of the barriers to usage. Unfortunately, there is also a corresponding dearth of objective analysis. Towards redressing the limitation of information, Cannabis: A Complete Guide is a comprehensive reference summarizing botanical, business, chemical, ecological, genetic, historical, horticultural, legal, and medical considerations that are critical for the wise advancement and management of cannabis in its various forms. This book documents both the risks and benefits of what is indisputably one of the world's most important species. The conflicting claims for medicinal virtues and toxicological vices are examined, based mainly on the most recent authoritative scientific reviews. The attempt is made consistently to reflect majority scientific opinion, although many aspects of cannabis are controversial. Aside from the relevance to specialists, the general public should find the presentation attractive because of the huge interest today in marijuana. Unfortunately, society has become so specialized and compartmentalized that most people have limited appreciation of the importance of science to their lives, except when a topic like marijuana becomes sensationalized. This review of cannabis can serve as a vehicle for public education in the realm of science and technology. Indeed, towards the goal of disseminating the important information in this book to a wide audience, the presentation is user-friendly, concise, and well-illustrated in the hope that non-specialists will find the topics both informative and entertaining. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

A common provision in state laws has provided a local option, which enables municipalities to prohibit commercial cannabis facilities within their borders. This paper examined potential determinants of prohibition decisions, with an emphasis on community and local government characteristics. Using a multivariate logistic regression model, determinants of local decisions to prohibit cannabis businesses in Michigan were analyzed. A unique feature of Michigan’s approach to legalization included separate local options to opt into medical marijuana and opt out of recreational marijuana. The results found that both community and local government characteristics explain variation in prohibitions on marijuana businesses. In general, local governments were more tolerant of marijuana businesses in areas with lower densities of senior citizens and higher densities of Black residents. However, the effects of some determinants varied based on whether the decision was to allow medical or recreational marijuana. Higher income areas were more likely to opt out of recreational marijuana, but they were no different from other areas on the likelihood of opting into medical marijuana. Prohibition decisions also were affected by local government characteristics, such as the number of members on city council, female representation, and having a council-manager form of government. © The Author(s) 2022.","cannabis; local government; marijuana; marijuana legalization","","SAGE Publications Inc."

Many banks explain that, because marijuana is illegal under federal law, they will not serve the industry. Even when marijuana-related businesses can open bank accounts, they still have trouble accepting credit cards and getting loans. Some hope to fix marijuana's banking problems with changes to federal law. Proposals range from broad reforms removing marijuana from the list of controlled substances to narrower legislation prohibiting banking regulators from punishing banks that serve the marijuana industry. But would these proposals solve marijuana's banking problems? In 2018, Congress legalized another variant of the Cannabis plant species: hemp. Prior to legalization, hemp-related businesses, like marijuana-related businesses, struggled with banking. Some hoped legalization would solve hemp's banking problems. It did not. By analyzing the hemp banking experience, this Article provides three insights. First, legalization does not necessarily lead to inexpensive, widespread banking services. Second, regulatory uncertainty hampers access to banking services. When banks were unsure what state and federal law required of hemp businesses and were unclear about bank regulators' compliance expectations for hemp-related accounts, they were less likely to serve the hemp industry. Regulatory structures that allow banks to easily identify who can operate cannabis businesses and verify whether the business is compliant with the law are more conducive to banking. Finally, even with clear law and favorable regulatory structures, the emerging cannabis industry will still present credit, market, and other risks that make some banks hesitant to lend.  © 2021 Julie Andersen Hill.","","","Boston University Law Review"

Supplanting British Columbia, Quebec now counts the largest number of cases of production of cannabis. Since this culture is profitable and relatively easy, criminal groups see in this business a quick and efficient way of making easy money. The profits from the cultivation and traffic of cannabis are often used to finance other illegal activities. This craze for culture has generated significant technological progress, particularly for domestic culture, improving profitability and quality of cannabis. Circumstantial evidence suggests that this production is not only used domestically to satisfy local drug users, but that a considerable proportion is exported to the United States.

Positive public attitudes and permissive policies are based on growing anecdotal experiences and medical evidence that enumerate the health benefits of cannabis. Against this backdrop, Muslim stakeholders are (re)-evaluating their stance on the issue for Muslim patients who may benefit from such novel treatments, Muslim physicians who could incorporate the provision of cannabis into practices, and Muslim entrepreneurs who may seek to engage with the pharmaceutical and business aspects of the growing industry. Given this renewed interest, the Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA), a deliberative body comprised of Islamic jurists and medical consultants, examined the medical as well as religious evidence surrounding medical cannabis in order to furnish Muslim Americans with religious guidance. In 2018, they resolved that, while the use of intoxicating substances is proscribed by Islamic law, medical cannabis was permissible for Muslims to use with the following stipulations: Non-psychoactive preparations of cannabis are permitted to treat illnesses for which therapeutic effects of cannabis are certain, and psychoactive preparations are contingently permissible in cases of dire necessity. In this paper we first discuss the deliberative process and ethico-legal rationale brought to bear in furnishing the ruling, and then proceed to critically examine its conceptual gaps, practical limitations, and future implications. Clarifying the nuances around the religious permissibility of medical cannabis is important for Muslim patients and providers whose attitudes and behaviors may be informed by the ruling, as well for stakeholder groups within pharmaceutical and health policy circles who aim to address the needs of the global Muslim community that may stand to benefit from advances in medical cannabis research and therapeutics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Fiqh Council of North America; Islamic perspectives; Medical cannabis; Religious bioethics","Humans; Islam; Medical Marijuana; North America; Physicians; Religion and Medicine; United States; medical cannabis; human; Islam; North America; physician; religion; United States","Elsevier B.V."

There are concerns that social media cannabis exposure may reach underage viewers. Our objective was to identify how cannabis businesses cultivate an online presence and exert influence that may reach youth. Methods: We chose a cyber-ethnographic approach to explore cannabis retailers on social media. We searched cannabis retailers with Facebook and Instagram presence from Alaska, Oregon, Colorado, and Washington, and identified 28 social media business profiles. One year of content was evaluated from each profile. In-depth, observational field notes were collected from researchers immersed in data collection on business profiles. Field notes were analyzed to uncover common themes associated with social media cannabis marketing. Results: A total of 14 businesses were evaluated across both Facebook and Instagram, resulting in 14 sets of combined field notes. A major theme was Normalization of Cannabis, involving both Broad Appeal and Specific Targeting. Conclusions: It is concerning that Normalization of Cannabis by cannabis businesses may increase cannabis acceptability among youth. In a digital world where the majority of youth are spending time online, it is important for policymakers to examine additional restrictions for cannabis businesses marketing through social media. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adolescent health; Cannabis; Ethnography; Marketing; Social media","Adolescent; Anthropology, Cultural; Cannabis; Commerce; Humans; Marketing; Social Media; cannabis; adolescent; commercial phenomena; cultural anthropology; human; marketing; social media","BioMed Central Ltd"

To assess whether cannabis control policies that may protect public health were adopted evenly across California localities with differing sociodemographic compositions. Methods. From November 2020 to January 2021, we measured cannabis control policies for 241 localities across California and linked them to data on the characteristics of the communities affected by these policies. We evaluated whether disadvantaged communities were more likely to allow cannabis businesses and less likely to be covered by policies designed to protect public health. Results. Localities with all-out bans on cannabis businesses (65% of localities) were disproportionately high-education (55.8% vs 50.5% with any college) and low-poverty (24.3% vs 34.2%), with fewer Black (4.4% vs 6.9%) and Latinx (45.6% vs 50.3%) residents. Among localities that allowed retail cannabis businesses (28%), there were more cannabis control policies in localities with more high-income and Black residents, although the specific policies varied. Conclusions. Cannabis control policies are unequally distributed across California localities. If these policies protect health, inequities may be exacerbated. © 2022 Authors.

Youth also self-reported cannabis use in the past year. We used logistic regression with a Bonferroni correction to compare the odds of cannabis use among youth with different levels of engagement with cannabis promotions and brands after controlling for demographics. Results: After adjusting for several possible confounders, youth who liked or followed a cannabis business on at least one social media platform had 5 times higher odds of past-year cannabis use (aOR = 5.00, 95% CI: 2.47, 10.09, p < 0.001).

With a panel of experts in substance use policy development and research, we identified key cannabis policies and their provisions enacted by U.S. states; rated their theoretical efficacy in a restrictive form for reducing problematic use and impaired driving in the context of a recreational cannabis market as judged by experts; and rated the strength of evidence for each policy. Methods: Using a modified Delphi approach, 9 panelists rated the comparative efficacy of 18 state cannabis policies for reducing youth use of cannabis, excessive cannabis use among the general population, and cannabis-impaired driving. Each outcome was rated separately using a Likert scale, and panelists also rated the strength of evidence supporting each efficacy rating. Investigators provided descriptions of each policy so that the nine panelists had similar conceptions of each policy. Results: State monopoly (state owns all production, manufacturing, wholesale, and retail operations) was rated as the most effective policy for all three outcome areas. Restrictions on retail physical availability, taxes, retail price restrictions, and retail operations restrictions were also highly rated for all three outcomes. Policies regulating cannabis businesses and products were judged more effective than policies targeting consumer use and behavior. Panelists reported there was little or no direct evidence from the cannabis policy literature for most of the included policies. Conclusion: These ratings can facilitate research as well as policy-making decisions. A relatively small number of policies were judged to be highly effective across all three domains, indicating that for the most part adult excessive use, youth use, and impaired driving can all be reduced with the same set of policies; these policies tended to target the behaviors of businesses rather than consumers. The low levels of direct evidence available to inform policy ratings, as reported by the policy panelists, makes clear the need for ongoing and sustained cannabis policy research. © 2022","Cannabis; Legalization; Marijuana; Policy","Adolescent; Adult; Analgesics; Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists; Cannabis; Commerce; Hallucinogens; Humans; Legislation, Drug; Policy; Taxes; United States; alcohol; cannabis; opiate; recreational drug; analgesic agent; cannabinoid receptor agonist; psychedelic agent; Article; cannabis use; clinical article; drug efficacy; human; management; policy; public health; substance use; tobacco; adolescent; adult; commercial phenomena; drug legislation; policy; tax; United States","Elsevier B.V."

These activities remain illegal at the U.S. federal level, creating a dual regulatory environment. The uncertainty related to the enforcement of federal cannabis laws affects businesses located in legalizing states, particularly federally-insured banks. Applying a difference-in-differences approach to a matched sample of banks in legalizing and non-legalizing states, we document an increase in audit fees incurred by banks located in legalizing states after cannabis legalization. This finding is consistent with increased auditor effort and engagement risk being an unintended consequence of state-level recreational cannabis legalization. In supplemental analysis, we find that the relation between banks’ audit fees and cannabis legalization was greater for banks having larger increases in banking activity, suggesting that audit fees increased primarily for banks that may be engaging in relationships with cannabis-related businesses. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Audit fees; Banking; Cannabis legalization; Conflicting regulatory environment; Enforcement uncertainty","","Elsevier Inc."

To generate creative ideas, some entrepreneurs turn to cannabis, proposing its benefits. However, extant research has not validated such claims. Using a new venture ideation task, we explore differences between cannabis users' and non-users' creativity in new venture ideation by assessing the originality and feasibility of their ideas. We theorized and found that cannabis users generate new venture ideas that are more original, but less feasible, compared to non-users. Further building upon creativity research emphasizing that motivation and knowledge shape creative thinking, we theorize that the cognitive effects of being a cannabis user on idea originality and feasibility are influenced by entrepreneurial passion for inventing—which reflects motivation to explore new venture ideas—and entrepreneurial experience (i.e., founding experience). Consistent with our theorizing, the increased originality and decreased feasibility of cannabis users' ideas surfaced to the extent that they had entrepreneurial passion for inventing and diminished commensurate with their entrepreneurial experience. Our study contributes to the literatures on new venture ideation, entrepreneurial passion, entrepreneurial experience, and cannabis users' creativity by providing an integrated perspective of cognitive, motivational, and experiential factors that drive entrepreneurs' creativity. Executive summary: New venture ideation is fundamentally creative, serving as a critical impetus to the entrepreneurial process. As such, scholars have long sought to understand the sources of creativity in new venture ideation, examining the influence of prior knowledge, alertness, experience, intuition, and pattern recognition, to name a few. Beyond such factors, certain drugs have long been used across a range of cultures to promote creativity. Perhaps most relevant in the present day is cannabis, which is becoming increasingly legitimized and used alongside a wave of legalization, with many advocating its creative benefits. However, little is known regarding whether entrepreneurs who use cannabis demonstrate enhanced creativity in new venture ideation. Whereas creativity research has generally found that cannabis users generate ideas of higher originality than non-users, new venture ideas must also be feasible if they are to be implemented in a manner that creates market value. Moreover, although entrepreneurship research has proposed and found evidence that some entrepreneurs use drugs in an attempt to cope with negative emotions and stress, understanding whether entrepreneurs' drug use of any kind is associated with differential performance on entrepreneurial tasks, whether positive or negative, is notably lacking. Drawing upon research on the cognitive influence of chronic cannabis use, we propose that cannabis users generate new venture ideas of higher originality, but lower feasibility, compared to non-users. Cannabis users are more impulsive, disinhibited, and better at identifying relationships among seemingly disparate concepts, holding potential to benefit their idea originality. However, such effects and cannabis users' impaired executive functioning likely detract from idea feasibility. We theorize additional contingencies of these relationships by building upon Runco and Chand's (1994, 1995) model of creative thinking, which holds that creative thinking is shaped by motivation and knowledge gained through experience. We theorize that entrepreneurial passion for inventing—which reflects motivation to explore new venture ideas—strengthens cannabis users' tendency to focus on idea originality to the detriment of idea feasibility. In contrast, entrepreneurial experience buffers such tendencies of cannabis users, encouraging a more pragmatic approach that is less focused on idea originality, but more focused on idea feasibility. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 254 entrepreneurs with founding experience by employing a new venture ideation task in which we separately account for the originality and feasibility of cannabis users' and non-users' new venture ideas. Cannabis users generated ideas of higher originality, but lower feasibility, compared to non-users. In addition, these differences were contingent upon entrepreneurial passion for inventing and entrepreneurial experience. Specifically, the higher originality and lower feasibility of cannabis users' ideas surfaced for entrepreneurs with high, but not low, entrepreneurial passion for inventing, and for those with low, but not high, entrepreneurial experience. Thus, entrepreneurial passion for inventing appears to play a role in channeling cannabis users toward idea originality but away from idea feasibility. Conversely, entrepreneurial experience appears to attenuate the positive relationship of being a cannabis user with idea originality and its negative relationship with idea feasibility. Our study contributes to literatures on new venture ideation, entrepreneurial passion, entrepreneurial experience, and cannabis users' creativity. Whereas research on creativity in business and entrepreneurial contexts often conflates originality and feasibility, the divergent effects we uncover highlight the importance of their separate consideration. We also contribute to the literatures on entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneurial experience by theorizing and finding evidence that their influence on creativity in new venture ideation differs based on cognitive factors, such as those that differ between cannabis users and non-users. Finally, we provide insight into the creative benefits and detriments associated with being a cannabis user, suggesting that cannabis usersespecially those who are passionate about exploring new venture ideas or those with relatively little entrepreneurial experience, may benefit from non-users' insights to develop the feasibility of their ideas. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cannabis/marijuana; Creativity; Entrepreneurial experience; Entrepreneurial passion for inventing; New venture ideation","","Elsevier Inc."

Even registered medicinal products based on herbal or synthetic cannabinoids, like Sativex, are practically unavailable due to their high cost and narrow scope of application (for example, in Lithuania). However, before the absolute prohibition of medical cannabis in the USSR, in line with Single Convention of 1961, the State Pharmacopoeia of the USSR (eighth edition) published monographs on such medicinal products as ""Herba Cannabis indicae"", ""Extractum Cannabis indicae spissum""and ""Fructus Cannabis"", which could be prescribed by physicians with precaution. Objectives: Formation of a holistic approach aimed at the creation of appropriate conditions for the development of medical cannabis market and the improvement of life quality and health of Ukrainian patients. Methods: We analyzed legislation and regulation mechanisms for medical cannabis in the USSR, and the present availability of these products for patients in the former USSR, such as Lithuania, Georgia, Estonia, Russian Federation, and Ukraine. Four hundred thirty-five Ukrainian pharmacy students participated in the quantitative analysis (a survey) that took place on April-May, 2019 at Bogomolets National Medical University (Kyiv, Ukraine). They were surveyed about legalization of medical cannabis in Ukraine, advisability of including cannabis and cannabinoids related data into educational programs, and other issues. Qualitative analysis we applied consisted of the stakeholder analysis and Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) analysis. We classified the key stakeholders into the patients, healthcare professionals, legislative and regulatory bodies, pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, etc., and ranked them based on their power and interest in the development of potential medical cannabis market in Ukraine. We also identified their expectations and goals. SWOT analysis allows us to evaluate predictable risks and opportunities, as well as strong and weak aspects of the effective development of medical cannabis industry in Ukraine. Results: According to the survey among pharmacy students, about 80% support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes. However, two-Thirds of them think that there is a risk of illicit turnover. Nearly half of the respondents are not informed or poorly informed about cannabis therapeutic properties. At the same time, nearly 90% consider that materials on medicinal properties of cannabis and cannabinoids should be included in the training program. Nowadays, such stakeholders as legislative and regulatory bodies have the highest power over the development of potential medical cannabis market in Ukraine: more than two million Ukrainian patients still cannot access an effective cannabinoids based treatment. There are over 20 thousand children among them suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy due to the lack of adequate legislation. Moreover, a lot of stakeholders with high level of interest, such as growers, manufacturers of cannabidiol (CBD) products, pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, higher education institutions, even scientists and healthcare professionals are still waiting for the legalization of cannabis for medical and scientific purposes in Ukraine. SWOT analysis shows that present business structures, educational and scientific institutions, regulatory bodies, and the competency of domestic specialists are strong enough to develop a new market of cannabis-based medicinal products in Ukraine. However, a long-Term ban on medical cannabis requires more time for creating the entire ecosystem. This market can be quite attractive in Ukraine. It is characterized by high growth rates, low entry barriers and a substantial demand. Yet, its advancement depends significantly on the appropriate regulatory framework, high level of awareness among health professionals and society as a whole, and involvement in scientific study to become a part of the global medical cannabis market. Discussion: The holistic approach is aimed to improve health and life quality of Ukrainian patients through cannabis-based medicinal products. It consists of three components: changes in legislation and regulation procedures; changes to value orientations in society; observance of stakeholders' interests and purposes. Specific recommendations are worked out to realize this approach in Ukraine.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Former USSR countries; Market regulations; Medical cannabis; Pharmacy students; Ukraine; USSR","cannabidiol; cannabinoid; medical cannabis; Article; drug industry; drug resistant epilepsy; education program; Estonia; Georgia (republic); health care personnel; holistic care; human; law; Lithuania; market; pharmacy (shop); pharmacy student; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quality of life; quantitative analysis; risk; society; Ukraine; Ukrainian (people); USSR","BioMed Central Ltd"

Drawing on 56 interviews with cannabis stakeholders collected between 2018-2020, I examine how different governmentalities of surveillance became distorted by the contradiction between state and federal cannabis laws. As in other regulated markets, these governmentalities informed state-sponsored surveillance initiatives to stop, contain, or support certain forms of deviance by commercial cannabis businesses. Due to fragmented governance, the efficacy of these initiatives depended in part upon the actions of the regulated cannabis industry. Commercial cannabis businesses looked to how surveillance was configured to develop strategies that could help them overcome challenges stemming from their semi-legality. These strategies included incorporating practices that were not required by law, partnering with the state in surveillance efforts, and engaging in activities to combat the black market. I argue that the embedded relationship between governmentalities, surveillance initiatives, and commercial cannabis activities transformed these strategies into mechanisms through which structure emerged in this nascent market. This paper introduces a set of surveillance categories, proposes new directions for research on social control and markets, and offers a novel study of commercial cannabis that can help to explain the trajectory of this market. © The Author(s) 2022.

This study examined spatiotemporal variations in availability of cannabis licensed cannabis businesses (i.e. producers, processors and retailers) in relation to area deprivation in Washington state from 2014 to 2017. Design and Methods: Data on licensed cannabis businesses were obtained from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board. The number of licensed cannabis businesses was estimated for Washington's 1446 census tracts. Census tracts were stratified into tertiles based on the Singh's Area Deprivation Index showing socio-economic characteristics of communities (least-deprived, middle-deprived and most-deprived). The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation approach allowed for the spatial and temporal characterisation of cannabis businesses, accounting for similarities based on neighbouring census tracts. Results: The density of all licensed cannabis outlets increased over time. Most-deprived areas have increased likelihood of licensed cannabis outlet density when compared to least-deprived areas. No differences were observed in the likelihood of licensed cannabis outlet density in middle-deprived areas when compared to least-deprived areas. Discussion and Conclusions: The results of this study showed disparity with respect to licensed cannabis outlet density in Washington state over time. The findings call for initiatives, policies and research that decrease disparities in cannabis outlet locations. © 2019 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs","area deprivation; GIS; INLA; licensed cannabis businesses; Washington state","Commerce; Humans; Legislation, Drug; Marijuana Smoking; Socioeconomic Factors; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Washington; cannabis smoking; commercial phenomena; drug legislation; economics; human; legislation and jurisprudence; socioeconomics; spatiotemporal analysis; Washington","Blackwell Publishing"

Ventilation and engineering techniques cannot reduce this pollution to healthy levels, and complete smoke-free policies are the only way to provide healthy indoor environments. Even so, multiple state and local governments have begun to allow indoor smoking of cannabis in businesses. Methods: A systematic search of Lexis Advance, NewsBank, and government websites for U.S. state and local laws passed between November 6, 2012 and June 10, 2020 that permit and regulate onsite cannabis consumption businesses was conducted in February–July 2020. Results: In total, 6 of 11 states and the District of Columbia that legalized adult-use cannabis as of June 10, 2020 allowed onsite consumption and ≥56 localities within these 6 states allowed onsite cannabis consumption. Only 9% (5/56) of localities ban indoor smoking in these businesses; 23% (13/56) require indoor smoking to occur in physically isolated rooms. Other common local legal requirements address onsite odor control, ventilation/filtration, and building location. Conclusions: The majority of the localities that allow onsite cannabis consumption do not explicitly prohibit smoking or vaping inside. Policymakers should be made aware that ventilation and other engineering interventions cannot fully protect workers and patrons. Health authorities and local leaders should educate policymakers on the science of secondhand smoke remediation and advocate for the same standards for secondhand cannabis smoking and vaping that apply to tobacco, particularly because other modes of cannabis administration do not pollute the air. © 2021 American Journal of Preventive Medicine","","Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Cannabis; Commerce; Humans; Smoke-Free Policy; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; cannabis; air conditioning; ambient air; Article; building; cannabis smoking; cannabis use; commercial phenomena; District of Columbia; filtration; isolation facility; legal aspect; odor control; policy; smoking ban; United States; adult; commercial phenomena; human; indoor air pollution; passive smoking; smoking ban","Elsevier Inc."

But as the legalization era continues and the legal cannabis industry starts to take shape, legalization advocates and industry stakeholders must reckon with a sobering reality: the benefits of legalization are not being equitably shared, and vulnerable communities that were hit the hardest during the war on drugs are not well represented in legal cannabis markets. This reality is as true for stakeholders of cannabis agriculture as it is for other sectors of the cannabis industry. As the first step in the supply chain, the cultivation of cannabis sets the tone for the industry as a whole. A wellregulated, equitable, and sustainable cannabis agriculture industry has significant catalytic potential for downstream market participants. Unfortunately, however, the cannabis agriculture industry suffers from many equity shortfalls. This Essay will explore three of these shortfalls: (1) access to agricultural lands and start-up capital, (2) cultivation licenses and state distribution of benefits, and (3) labor standards and farmworker protections. While there are many more equity issues facing cannabis agriculture, this Essay shines a light on these three while identifying areas of concern for future research. It is clear that stakeholders of cannabis agriculture, including regulators and business owners, can and should prioritize equity and participation in the development of their industry. © 2021 Boston University Law Review.

The present study surveyed 301 law enforcement officers in Oregon three years after the state legalized recreational marijuana.

Some Latin American governments which joined this wave also had the objective of promoting investments and exports. However, these expectations have yet to be fully validated. Although investments have arrived, so far export activity is very weak and domestic markets are still small. The objective of this paper is to show that even when the demand, the entrepreneurship and the technical knowledge needed to develop a cannabis industry were available, the creation of the institutional infrastructure required for guaranteeing a sound transition from black to legal markets has been a slow process of trial and error, which has curbed growth rates in this new industry.

This qualitative study investigated the following research questions.1.Why are some Certified Public Accountants unwilling to provide services to cannabis-related businesses?2.How do CRBs compensate for lack of Certified Public Accountant services?3.What does a certified public accountant need to know about the cannabis industry prior to engaging to provide services to CRBs? Methods: Data for this grounded-theory qualitative study was gathered from twenty-three semi-structured phone and face-to-face interviews. Ten cannabis-related business owners were recruited from a convenience sample after attempting a broad recruiting effort. Thirteen Certified Public Accountants with active licenses in Colorado or Washington State participated from firms of varying size and willingness to serve the cannabis industry. The individual interviews, which lasted from twenty minutes to more than an hour, focused on the participants’ perceptions of the complexities of accounting and tax compliance for cannabis businesses. Results: Eight of the thirteen Certified Public Accountants interviewed would not provide services to the cannabis industry with the primary reason given that cannabis is federally illegal. All ten of the cannabis business owners interviewed indicated they engage a Certified Public Accountant to provide tax services. Seven out of ten CRB participants and ten of the thirteen Certified Public Accountant participants indicated that extensive industry knowledge is needed for an accountant to competently provide services to a CRB. Conclusions: CRB owners need to carefully consider the industry knowledge and experience of a potential Certified Public Accountant prior to engaging them. This study shows that US Certified Public Accountants should weigh the risk of federal prosecution and potential loss of the Certified Public Accountant license when deciding whether to serve a CRB client. The study also found that a Certified Public Accountant must commit to acquiring and maintaining substantial specialized knowledge related to tax Code Section 280E, internal controls for a cash-only or cash-intensive business, and the workings of the cannabis industry under the current regulatory conditions. © 2020, The Author(s).","Accounting; Business; Cannabis; Certified Public Accountants; Colorado; Financial regulation; Marijuana; Washington State","cannabis; accounting; Article; Colorado; commercial phenomena; compensation; data analysis software; government; grounded theory; human; industry; licence; priority journal; qualitative research; semi structured interview; tax; telephone interview; Washington","BioMed Central Ltd"

This study examined whether cannabis marketing exposure and engagement are associated with problematic cannabis use among adolescents. Method: The analytic sample included 172 lifetime cannabis users (15–19 years old) who lived in one of six states with legalized nonmedical cannabis in 2018. Predictors included having exposure to or engagement with cannabis marketing on Facebook or Instagram, seeing cannabis billboards, owning/likely to own cannabisbranded merchandise, and reporting a favorite cannabis brand. Logistic regression assessed whether these predictors were associated with weekly cannabis use, high-intensity cannabis use, and cannabis use disorder (CUD). Results: Adolescents who saw billboards rarely/sometimes had 5 times the odds of CUD, whereas youth who saw them most/all of the time had 7 times the odds of weekly use and 6 times the odds of CUD. Adolescents who owned/were likely to own branded merchandise had nearly 23 times the odds of weekly use, and those with a favorite brand had 3 times the odds of weekly use and CUD. Adolescents who reported seeing promotions on Instagram rarely/sometimes had 85% lower odds of weekly use, and those who saw them most/all of the time had 93% lower odds. Conclusions: The ways cannabis businesses market their products, especially branding, may affect patterns of underage cannabis use. Future research should test whether these associations persist in longitudinal designs. In the interim, states should consider an approach that offers youth additional means to protect them from cannabis marketing. (J. Stud.

This article reviews the mechanisms of introduction of psychoactive substances such as alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea and cannabis to populations and communities that did not have them before. It considers the historical tension between early adopters who greet new substances with various levels of enthusiasm in their eagerness to enjoy what they believe to be the benefits of using these substances, and those focused on what they believe to be the negative aspects of use, who decry these new substances with horror. With more nonusers than users in the population, social policies tend to be directed at preventing, restricting, or punishing selected use, users and.drugs., using controls and interventions such regulation, incarceration, death sentence, treatment, prevention, legalization, taxation, among others. Whatever their intent or wished-for impact, all had consequences that produced additional, unplanned for, and (often) negative effects. This paper will consider some of these sequences as they occurred historically with other substances in light of the current shift to legalization and normalization of cannabis, noting the mechanisms of use, controls, and consequences of some types of formal interventions and give some attention to how and what we can learn from our experiences in order to plan ahead and become better prepared to successfully deal with the unexpecteds of that well-known hell paved with good intentions. © 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","addiction; alcohol; cannabis; coffee; controls; criminalization; driving under the influence of drugs; history; legalization; normalization; psychoactive substances; regulation; tea; tobacco","History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; History, Ancient; Humans; Marijuana Smoking; Psychotropic Drugs; Public Policy; psychotropic agent; cannabis smoking; history; human; legislation and jurisprudence; policy","Taylor and Francis Ltd."

We further characterize this syndrome with eight well-documented cases in the United States and report results of cannabis discontinuation and cannabis rechallenge. Study Methods: Patients were identified by the three investigators in gastroenterology clinic or inpatient wards at William Beaumont Hospital from January to August 2009 based on chronic cannabis use; otherwise unexplained refractory, recurrent vomiting; and compulsive bathing. Charts were retrospectively analyzed with follow-up data obtained from subsequent physician visits and patient interviews. Results: The eight patients on average were 32.4 ± 4.1 years old. Five were male. The mean interval between the onset of cannabis use and development of recurrent vomiting was 19.0 ± 3.7 years. Patients had a mean of 7.1 ± 4.3 emergency room visits, 5.0 ± 2.7 clinic visits, and 3.1 ± 1.9 admissions for this syndrome. All patients had visited at least one other hospital in addition to Beaumont Hospital. All patients had vomiting (mean vomiting episodes every 3.0 ± 1.7 h), compulsive bathing (mean = 5.0 ± 2.0 baths or showers/day; mean total bathing time = 5.0 ± 5.1 h/day), and abdominal pain. Seven patients took hot baths or showers, and seven patients experienced polydipsia. Four out of five patients who discontinued cannabis use recovered from the syndrome, while the other three patients who continued cannabis use, despite recommendations for cessation, continued to have this syndrome. Among those four who recovered, one patient had recurrence of vomiting and compulsive bathing with cannabis resumption. Conclusions: Cannabis hyperemesis is characterized by otherwise unexplained recurrent nausea and vomiting, compulsive bathing, abdominal pain, and polydipsia associated with chronic cannabis use.

The current study examined the spatial relationship between cannabis and licensed tobacco retailers in Los Angeles County, California, and assessed whether various neighborhood and business factors influenced the spatial patterning. Method: Generalized additive models were used to test the association between the location of cannabis retailers (N = 429) and their accessibility potential (AP) to tobacco retailers (N = 8,033). The covariates included cannabis licensure status, median household income, population density, percentages of racial/ ethnic minorities and young adults (18–34), unemployment status, families living in poverty, minimum completion of high school/General Educational Development (GED) credential, and industrial businesses by census tract. Results: The location of cannabis retailers was significantly associated with AP in all adjusted models (p <.005). The percentage of racial/ethnic minorities, age (18–34 years), and nonlicensure of cannabis retailers, which were positively correlated with AP (p <.05), confounded the association between AP and cannabis retailer location. Conclusions: The concentration of unlicensed cannabis retailers and tobacco retailers in young and racially/ethnically diverse neighborhoods may increase access to and use of cigarillos for blunt smoking. Jurisdictions within Los Angeles County should consider passing ordinances requiring minimum distances between cannabis and tobacco retailers. © 2022, Alcohol Research Documentation Inc.

Case overview/synopsis: Wisikk is a Mi’kmaq sovereign reserve territory located in Mi’kmaq’ki in the place that settler governments call Nova Scotia. The community has existed in its location since time immemorial and has been recognized by the settler government since the early 19th century. An opportunity for community-run business has arisen for Wisikk based on the legalization of cannabis throughout Canada in 2018. This case’s protagonist is the community’s Vice-President for Business Development, Andrew Googoo, as he considers bringing a proposal for a cannabis retailing venture to the Chief and Council. Cannabis legalization in Canada left sales policies to the provinces and was silent as to the rules governing cannabis sales by indigenous communities on their sovereign territory. Considering both potential negative impacts to the community, as well as the potential financial benefits from a successful reserve-based cannabis dispensary, Andrew must soon present his initial findings to the Chief and Council for their deliberation and decision. Any venture undertaken by the reserve would require a loan from the FNFA, so Andrew must also consider the projections and reports that the FNFA would require to support their lending decision. Complexity academic level: The case is appropriate for mid-level or capstone undergraduate and graduate business courses, especially those focused on entrepreneurship, business ownership or indigenous ownership. The case was originally developed for the accounting division of an international undergraduate case competition. In addition to accounting concepts like pro forma/budgeted income statements and decision analysis, it is intended to showcase some legal and cultural features of community-led indigenous business ventures. The idea is for students to explore concepts of sovereignty, community involvement and broader stakeholder impact, as well as more technical accounting and financial concepts. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cannabis; Community Business; Corporate culture; Decolonization; Indigenous business; Indigenous cultures; Projection; Retailing","","Emerald Publishing"

There is significant variability in findings across studies, thus a discussion of potential moderators is increasingly relevant.

Method: The study team obtained records of all Washington State cannabis marketing violations from October 2014 to September 2015, immediately following the legal cannabis market opening, and May 2017 to July 2019. A code book was developed based on the Washington State regulations related to marijuana advertising. Each marketing violation was coded according to ad characteristics including ad size, location, or type; content; business practices; and lack of mandatory health warnings. Results: A total of 328 violations were analyzed, from 183 different businesses. Marketing violations occurred most frequently in content posted online or directly in front of cannabis stores. Community members were as likely to identify violations as officers from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB), the state agency in charge of regulation and enforcement of cannabis businesses. Very few violations were reported from competing members of the cannabis industry. Violations reported by the community were mostly related to content appealing to minors, whereas WSLCB officers were more likely to identify violations related to ad location in public spaces and ad size. Conclusions: This study shows the conflict between prevention and profit in the nascent cannabis industry and the importance of community involvement in the regulation of cannabis marketing. © 2022, Alcohol Research Documentation Inc..

To understand the range of issues that can arise when such a policy change is enacted, we examined portrayal of legalization at the local level by studying newspaper articles in Calgary, Alberta, shortly before and after cannabis legalization in Canada. Method: We searched the largest-circulation newspaper for cannabis-related items and analyzed for content and slant toward cannabis legalization. Results: Among 165 items, business/economics (70.9% of items) and legalization (69.7%) were most frequent, with health only 29.7%. Across all items, the slant was more approval (44.2%) than disapproval (23.0%). Discussion and Conclusions: When cannabis was legalized, the local newspaper focused more on economic aspects of legalization rather than about health issues. Further research can determine the generalizability of the findings to other locales and provide comparison as other similar policy changes roll out.

The purpose of this article to rethink cannabis tourism as an agent of normalization. In adopting cannabis as a resource, the tourism industry sets standards that become embedded in a broader context of social acceptance. Evidence from a study that documents cannabis tourism in Canada in the first few years following legalization is used to illustrate how tourism suppliers have adopted cannabis as a resource.

The path to legal recreational use began with a series of policy events that expanded the state’s medical marijuana program to include the creation of dispensaries and significantly increase the number of registered users. Voters convincingly passed a constitutional amendment that permitted commercial sale of recreational marijuana, and the state has created a regulatory model, based on a private business model, to address potential negative impacts. Colorado has used state- and local-level licensing, statues, and regulations to address regulatory challenges regarding product potency, cannabis edibles, worksite and worker issues, impaired driving, commercial growing operations, locations of outlets and sites of use, and other policy issues. Jurisdictions considering recreational legalizations should consider a “harm reduction” approach to regulation that is responsive to addressing evolving adverse effects and addresses child safety, traffic safety, cannabis product safety, work and worksite safety, and other aspects of the business model in order to provide a careful approach to recreational use. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cannabis; Colorado; Marijuana regulation","","Springer New York LLC"

A 2019 grounded theory qualitative study posed that CPAs remain largely hesitant to serve the cannabis industry primarily because they fear federal prosecution as long as cannabis remains on the DEA’s Schedule I Drug List. The purpose of this research was to determine the perceptions of CPAs regarding providing accounting services to the cannabis industry in states that have legalized cannabis usage. This study investigated whether CPAs would serve the industry, why they might decline to serve the industry, what risks they believe serving the industry posed, and whether they believe serving the cannabis industry would create a moral or ethical issue. Methods: This follow-up quantitative study investigated a small convenience sample of approximately one hundred CPAs in Colorado and Washington to learn more about their perceptions of serving the cannabis industry. Data was analyzed using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests to determine if there were any differences in perceptions between groups such as states, gender, and age categories. Results: Of the participants, 77% responded that neither they nor their firm provided services to a cannabis-related business client compared to 23% that did serve cannabis clients. More Colorado CPAs were willing to turn down CRB work than were expected and fewer Colorado CPAs would be willing to take on CRB clients than were expected. While in Washington, fewer CPAs would turn down RB clients than expected, and more are willing to accept CRB clients than were expected. The risk due to potential liability coverage issues due to serving the cannabis industry was rated the highest while the risk of losing the CPA license was rated lowest. Data indicated that there was not a statistically significant difference between Colorado and Washington participants related to whether they were morally or religiously opposed to working in the industry or if they viewed serving the industry as an ethical violation. Conclusion: CPAs remain largely unwilling to serve the cannabis industry primarily because CPAs fear federal prosecution as long as cannabis remains on the DEA’s Schedule I Drug Listing. The results of this study indicate that while most CPAs are not morally or religiously opposed to serving the industry, about half still believe doing so may constitute an ethical violation for a CPA. © 2022, The Author(s).","Accounting; Cannabis; Cannabis industry; Certified public accounting; CPA; Ethics","cannabis; accounting; adult; Article; cannabis use; certified public accountant; Colorado; convenience sample; drug industry; female; follow up; human; law; licence; male; medical ethics; perception; professional ethics; quantitative study; recreational drug use; Washington","BioMed Central Ltd"

While broader debates anticipated the significance of the UN drug conventions, the extent to which Uruguay’s drug treaty obligations shaped regulation is unclear and the relevance of finance norms has been neglected. Drawing on institutionalist and governance theories, this study explores how international drug and finance regulations limited Uruguay’s policy space to implement cannabis regulation, and how this was perceived by policy actors. Policy documents and 43 semi-structured interviews were thematically analysed. The analysis demonstrates how Uruguay’s drug treaty obligations were less directly constraining to policy space compared to international finance norms, including the US Patriot Act, anti-money laundering standards and financial inclusion practices. Such norms exerted powerful influence over Uruguay’s ability to implement aspects of cannabis supply that interact with broader financial systems, allowing banks to terminate business relationships with clients deemed as high risks for money laundering. The Uruguayan case suggests that financial regulations at diverse levels are likely to constrain policy space in other contexts where the market-based policies of cannabis regulation raise tensions with a narrowly constructed risk management principle in approaches to financial supply. © 2023 The Author(s).

The plant has also been widely consumed in the African continent since time immemorial. In particular, Lesotho has been largely growing Cannabis since approximately the 1550s and was illegally grown and unlawfully used for both medicinal and recreational purposes. It was only in 2017 when Lesotho started licensing Cannabis companies and regulating cultivation of Cannabis for medicinal purposes. However, the Lesotho Cannabis industry seems to have excluded the Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) in the legalisation of Cannabis, the sector has the potential for small Cannabis enterprises in Lesotho. Objective: This study attempts to examine challenges facing the evolving Cannabis sector in Lesotho as envisaged by Cannabis company managers with the aim of being proactive while addressing such challenges. Methods: The qualitative descriptive method was employed using both primary and secondary data. For the selection of the three Cannabis managers exponential non-discriminative snowball sampling was adopted and interviews with the managers were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the descriptive explanations of the Cannabis managers to determine the themes that were further consolidated into categories. Results: The implementation and compliance with the laws in the Lesotho medicinal Cannabis sector has proved very challenging, with long timeframes for finalising regulatory frameworks and not being applied objectively. The industry does not provide opportunities for Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) to venture into the Cannabis business. Conclusion: In Lesotho, the Cannabis sector appears to be faced with many challenges emanating from the implementation and enforcement of Cannabis laws. The Lesotho Government should review its Cannabis laws and regulations with a view to benefiting SMMEs and legalising Cannabis production so as to serve both the domestic and international markets. © The Author(s) 2024.","Cannabis industry; Cannabis production; Medicinal Cannabis","medical cannabis; adult; Article; data processing; descriptive research; drug industry; drug legislation; drug marketing; female; human; interview; laboratory; Lesotho; licence; male; middle aged; protocol compliance; qualitative research; skill; thematic analysis; young adult","BioMed Central Ltd"

The impact of CSA on young adults' use of cannabis remains under-studied. We examined the extent to which exposure to CSA was associated with increased rates of use of cannabis in early adulthood in a birth cohort of 3,285 Australian children followed-up to the age of 21 years, when retrospective reports of CSA were obtained from sample participants along with information on their use of cannabis at 21 years. Young adult men and women who reported experiencing CSA had significantly higher rates of frequent use of cannabis in early adulthood, defined as use of cannabis at least ""every few days."" In multivariate analyses, men who reported a history of CSA had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 (95% CI = 1.1-3.9) for frequent use of cannabis at the age of 21 years. For women, there was an OR of 3.9 (95% CI = 2.4-6.3). Family and individual factors measured earlier in the study did not confound these associations. The findings suggest that children experiencing CSA have a substantially greater risk of use of cannabis and, in particular, its frequent use in early adulthood.

These transformations occurred at the same time voters in the state struck down prohibition in 2018, arguably facilitating an even more anomic environment for medical cannabis patients and stakeholders. Data presented here comes from an eclectic mix of key informant interviews (n = 9), focus groups of cannabis patients (n = 21), informal researcher observations, and news reports. These are combined to create a case study that illuminates a variety of tensions during a transformational time. Results are then broken down between two overarching themes—How new regulations favoring big businesses made medical cannabis scarce for patients, and how the inclusion of caregivers in the new regulatory system may have prevented such a scarcity. Following the results is a discussion which synthesizes the literature on medical cannabis social movements and the cannabis subculture with the tensions and controversies documented in Michigan. The article concludes with implications and practical strategies for regulatory bodies as both medical and adult-use cannabis moves from the underground and into the formal economy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cannabis; cannabis subculture; medicalization; Michigan; regulations; small-scale growers","","Taylor and Francis Ltd."

This study sought to describe the cannabis industry's lobbying activities in the Colorado State Legislature over time. Methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed publicly available lobbying expenditures data from fiscal years (FY) 2010–2021. Measures included inflation-adjusted monthly lobbying expenditures by funder and lobbyist, origin of funding, and lobbyist descriptions of cannabis industry clients. This dataset was supplemented with business license documentation, legislative histories, and public testimony. Results: The cannabis industry spent over $7 million (inflation adjusted) from FY 2010–2021 to lobby the Colorado legislature on 367 bills. Over $800,000 (11% of total cannabis spending) was from out-of-state clients. In 48% of lobbyist reports lobbyists did not disclose their funder's cannabis affiliation, and cannabis organizations used strategies that may have obscured the true amount and source of funding. Lobbyists and agencies concurrently represented the alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis industries, possibly facilitating inter-industry alliances when interests align. Conclusion: The cannabis industry dedicated significant resources towards lobbying the Colorado State Legislature on behalf of policies intended to increase cannabis use. Creating transparency about the relationships between the cannabis industry, related industries, and policymakers is essential to ensure appropriate regulation of cannabis products. © 2022","Cannabis; Colorado; Lobbying; Policy; Public health","Cannabis; Colorado; Humans; Industry; Lobbying; Tobacco; Tobacco Industry; Tobacco Products; cannabis; alcohol industry; Article; cannabis industry; cannabis use; caregiver; case study; controlled study; documentation; drug industry; fiscal policy; health care organization; human; industry; law; licensing; observational study; pregnant woman; retrospective study; risk factor; self report; tobacco industry; Colorado; industry; lobbying; tobacco; tobacco industry","Elsevier B.V."

In the era of legalized cannabis use, retail cannabis companies often use social media marketing on platforms popular among youth. The purpose of this study was to evaluate adherence to state-based regulations for restricted and required content across social media from recreational cannabis busi-nesses. Method: A retrospective content analysis was used to evaluate one year of publicly displayed posts by retail cannabis companies on Facebook and Instagram from four states in which recreational cannabis use is legal (Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington State). We evaluated restricted content including the following: (a) business practices, such as avoiding discounts/promotions or promoting branded products; (b) modeling cannabis use or overconsumption; (c) youth-focused messaging; and (d) health benefits. We evaluated required content including three types of warnings: (a) limiting cannabis use to those age 21 and over, (b) avoiding impaired driving, and (c) describing health risks. Results: A total of 2,660 posts were evaluated from 14 businesses. In the area of restricted content, discounts/promotions were present in approximately 35% of all posts. Another common category was overconsumption, found in 12% of posts. Required content regarding warnings was present in less than half of all social media posts. Conclusions: Despite state-based advertising restrictions, recreational cannabis business pages use messages with youth appeal. Required safety message adherence is not typical on social media business pages. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 83, 27–36, 2022). © 2022, Alcohol Research Documentation Inc..

This can decouple the intention behind policies from the practices to implement them. When state interests do not align concerning the legality of a market, can policy and practice recouple, and if so, how? This article reports on a case study of commercial cannabis in the United States to answer this question. Interviews with 56 cannabis industry stakeholders in California, Arizona, and Texas reveal that policy and practice recoupled through a patterned process that I call sumptuary administration. In each state, regulators drew on a unique set of schemas, or “framework of accountability,” that prioritized a subset of cannabis market participants during the policy-making process. This resulted in missing or ambiguous sumptuary laws. To address business challenges that were tethered to this regulatory environment, cannabis businesses drew on similar schemas to identify appropriate practices. I show how grounding practices in these frameworks legitimized the preferences of the cannabis industry in the eyes of state authorities and influenced specific program policy revisions. Sumptuary administration represents a novel mechanism for understanding the social construction of legality in markets that are regulated under fragmented governance. © 2023 University of Denver and Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","","John Wiley and Sons Inc"

However, research is impeded by a lack of data measuring the scale of home delivery. Prior research demonstrated that crowdsourced websites can be used to validly enumerate brick-and-mortar cannabis outlets. We piloted an extension of this method to explore the feasibility of measuring availability of cannabis home delivery. Method: We tested implementation of an automated algorithm designed to webscrape data from Weedmaps, the largest crowdsourced website for cannabis retail, to count the number of legal cannabis retailers offering home delivery to the geographic centroid of each Census block group in California. We compared these estimates to the number of brick-and-mortar outlets within each block group. To assess data quality, we conducted follow-up telephone interviews with a subsample of cannabis delivery retailers. Results: We successfully implemented the webscraping. Of the 23,212 block groups assessed, 22,542 (97%) were served by at least one cannabis delivery business. Only 461 block groups (2%) contained one or more brick-and-mortar outlets. In interviews, availability varied dynamically as a function of staffing levels, order sizes, time of day, competition, and demand. Conclusions: Webscraping crowdsourced websites could be a viable method for quantifying rapidly evolving availability of cannabis home delivery. However, key practical and conceptual challenges must be overcome to conduct a full-scale validation and develop methodological standards. Acknowledging data limitations, cannabis home delivery appears to be nearly universal in California, whereas availability of brick-and-mortar outlets is limited, underscoring the need for research on home delivery. © 2023, Alcohol Research Documentation Inc..

A process of restructuring following an crackdown on 'Pusher Street' has involved at least four people getting shot and killed in what police describe as struggles for market shares. Combating the retail cannabis market was a top three priority for the Copenhagen police. The shift in policy started in 2004 when possession for personal use was up-penalized, from a discriminatory warning to an obligatory fine of 70 euros which was quadrupled in 2007. The law was immediately followed by an extensive police crackdown on Christiania's open retail-market. Christiania has had a cannabis market for 32 years. As cannabis use rates rose throughout the '90's the market flourished. On a given day it's estimated turnover was around 20 k, about twothirds of the total market in Copenhagen. On the 16th of May 2004 police raided 'Pusher Street' and arrested 60 dealers and their helpers along with 20 people accused of forming an organized lookout corps. After the initial raid police implemented a zero-tolerance zone in the area and targeted users in a deterrent effort issuing a total of 4834 fines in a year. Maintaining the zero tolerance zone has so far involved 12 big confrontations with the inhabitants of Christiania. 114 police officers have been injured and 29 formal complaints of police conduct have been lodged with the State Attorney.

Addressing inequities is increasingly featured in discussions to legalize cannabis supply and adult possession for nonmedical purposes. While there is little disagreement that these inequities exist, those hoping to use cannabis policy to respond to them have proposed multiple options that each come with their own set of potential benefits and costs. This Essay describes some of these opportunities as well as some major puzzles and trade-offs surrounding the use of cannabis policy to advance social equity. Additionally, it offers insights into the number of people who could benefit from various social equity efforts related to cannabis policy. In particular, sealing or expunging cannabis possession convictions could affect many more BIPOC-possibly close to two orders of magnitude more-than prioritizing these individuals for entrepreneurship or employment opportunities in the cannabis industry. These options are not mutually exclusive, but decision makers should consider the possibility of federal legalization and what it will mean for small cannabis businesses when developing cannabis equity programs. © 2021 Boston University Law Review.

Respiratory and dermal exposures, musculoskeletal hazards, and other agricultural hazards have been identified in previous research. Even in a post-legalization framework, cannabis work is stigmatized and most cannabis is still produced illegally. Qualitative research is essential for establishing rapport with cannabis workers to understand their experiences and concerns. Methods: We conducted semi-structured discussions with four focus groups including 32 cannabis workers total, and 9 key informants who were workers, industry experts, and business owners or managers. Transcribed results were analyzed to identify key themes on physiological exposures and health effects. Results: The majority (81.3%) of focus group participants were seasonal migrant cannabis trimmers. Themes emerged of respiratory and dermal exposures and outcomes, musculoskeletal disorders, and physical hazards including living conditions. Workers reported respiratory symptoms and rashes from exposure to cannabis, mold, and pesticides. Musculoskeletal pain was ubiquitous due to inadequate seating and long shifts performing repetitive tasks. Seasonal workers experienced chronic exposure to cold conditions and unsanitary housing. Management-level interviewees and other industry stakeholders described concerns and experiences that differed from those of workers. Discussion: The results were consistent with existing research on cannabis worker health, with workers reporting respiratory and dermal exposure and symptoms, musculoskeletal hazards, and physical hazards associated with agricultural work. In addition, we found that workers were affected by substandard living conditions, remote and isolated work environments, and an absence of training. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","agriculture; cannabis; migrant workers; occupational health","Agriculture; California; Cannabis; Humans; Occupational Exposure; Pesticides; cannabis; pesticide; adverse event; agriculture; California; human; occupational exposure","John Wiley and Sons Inc"

In addition to typical occupational health and safety hazards associated with chemical and physical exposures, the transition from an illicit to a regulated workplace, the inconsistency between state and federal law, and the production of a unique psychoactive commodity crop that maintains value in the illicit marketplace creates a unique work environment with workplace concerns that are political, economic, and social in nature. Methods: We conducted a combination of semistructured key informant interviews targeted toward employers, focus groups that engaged employees, and an online survey with cannabis business owners and employees to identify concerns relating to worker health and safety. Results: In addition to physical and chemical hazards related to their workplace, workers described health concerns that were a result of social, economic, and political forces facing the transitioning cannabis industry and resulting from an inconsistency between state and federal law. Important themes that emerged from these data included the legal and regulatory environment that the cannabis industry faces, cannabis as an agricultural good, crime, gender, cannabis consumption in the workplace, changing worker demographics, and emerging technologies in this rapidly evolving industry. Conclusions: The unique sociopolitical challenges for occupational health and safety that we identified among cannabis workers in Washington State are especially relevant as other states and nations follow the example of Washington State in legalizing the widespread commercial cultivation, sale, and use of cannabis. As other states and nations legalize, it will be important for employers, public health practitioners, and regulators to recognize how transitioning from an illicit to a legal marketplace impacts worker health. Further, understanding the challenges that result in transitioning a cannabis workforce may be extrapolated in the future to better understand how transitioning other goods and services from an unregulated to a regulated marketplace may impact worker health. © The Author(s) 2019.

While this market is growing, sales still occur through unregulated channels. This systematic review identifies factors influencing cannabis purchasing to help policymakers understand why consumers still purchase illicit market cannabis (registered with PROSPERO CRD42020176079). Methods: A comprehensive search strategy included databases in health, business, and social science fields (inception to June 2020). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were conducted with persons who purchase cannabis and examine at least one attribute that would influence purchase choice and were published in the English language. Studies could be of any methodological design. Two independent reviewers completed two levels of screening, and all extraction was verified by a second reviewer. A qualitative synthesis of the findings was completed. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: Of the 4839 citations screened, 96 were eligible for full-text review and 35 were included in the final synthesis. Aspects of price were the most common factors (27 studies). Twenty studies measured price elasticity; most studies found that demand was price inelastic. Many other attributes were identified (e.g., product quality, route of administration, product recommendations, packaging), but none were explored in depth. Eleven studies addressed aspects of product quality including demand elasticity based on quality, potency, and aroma. Studies also explored consumer-perceived “quality” but provided no definition; differences in quality appeared to impact consumer choice. Smoking cannabis appeared to be the preferred route of administration but was only examined in three studies. There was insufficient data to understand in the impact of other attributes on choice. There appeared to be preference heterogeneity for different attributes based on the consumer’s experience, reason for use, and gender. Conclusion: While price influences choices, demand is relatively inelastic. This suggests that consumers may be seeking lowest-cost, unregulated cannabis to avoid reducing consumption. Beyond price, there is a significant gap in our understanding of consumer choices. Perceived quality does appear to impact choice; however, more research is needed due to the lack of a recognized definition for cannabis quality. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cannabis; Cannabis policy; Choice attributes; Price elasticity; Public health; Purchase decisions","cannabis; opiate; adult; aroma; cannabis use; consumer; drug choice; drug packaging; drug potency; English (language); female; gender; human; male; price elasticity; product quality; purchasing; Review; systematic review","BioMed Central Ltd"

Cannabis companies also pay more non-audit fees before and after legalization, consistent with additional business opportunities for their auditors. The size of cannabis companies grew substantially after Canada's 2018 legalization, corresponding with increased occurrences of Big 4 cannabis company audits. However, compared to a matched sample of non-cannabis companies and controlling for size, cannabis companies are less (more) likely to be audited by a Big 4 (second-tier) firm. This observation is likely attributed to the reputation risk from being associated with a cannabis client, which is potentially higher for Big 4 firms than second-tier firms. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Audit risk; Big 4 auditor; Cannabis legalization; Reputational risk; Second-tier auditor","","Elsevier Inc."

Cannabis ""legalization"" hasn't lived up to the hype. Across North America, investors are reeling, tax collections are below projections, and people are pointing fingers. On the business side, companies have shut down, farms have failed, workers have lost their jobs, and consumers face high prices. Why has legal weed failed to deliver on many of its promises? Can Legal Weed Win? takes on the euphoric claims with straight dope and a full dose of economic reality. This book delivers the unadulterated facts about the new legal segment of one of the world's oldest industries. In witty, accessible prose, economists Robin Goldstein and Daniel Sumner take readers on a whirlwind tour of the economic past, present, and future of legal and illegal weed. Drawing upon reams of data and their own experience working with California cannabis regulators since 2016, Goldstein and Sumner explain why many cannabis businesses and some aspects of legalization fail to measure up, while others occasionally get it right. Their stories stretch from before America's first medical weed dispensaries opened in 1996 through the short-term boom in legal consumption that happened during COVID-19 lockdowns. Can Legal Weed Win? is packed with unexpected insights about how cannabis markets can thrive, how regulators get the laws right or wrong, and what might happen to legal and illegal markets going forward. © 2022 by Robin S.

The CSA does not apply to all drugs. Rather, it applies to specific substances and categories of substances that have been designated for control by Congress or through administrative proceedings. The statute also applies to controlled substance analogues that are intended to mimic the effects of controlled substances and certain precursor chemicals commonly used in the manufacturing of controlled substances. Controlled substances subject to the CSA are divided into categories known as Schedules I through V based on their medical utility and their potential for abuse and dependence. Substances considered to present the greatest risk to the public health and safety are subject to the most stringent controls and sanctions. A lower schedule number corresponds to greater restrictions, so substances in Schedule I are subject to the strictest controls, while substances in Schedule V are subject to the least strict. Most substances subject to the CSA are also subject to other federal or state regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the federal agency primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing the CSA. DEA may designate a substance for control through notice-and-comment rulemaking if the substance satisfies the applicable statutory criteria. The agency may also place a substance under temporary control on an emergency basis if the substance poses an imminent hazard to public safety. In addition, DEA may designate a substance for control under the United States' international treaty obligations. In the alternative, Congress may place a substance under control by statute. The CSA simultaneously aims to protect public health from the dangers of controlled substances diverted into the illicit market while also seeking to ensure that patients have access to pharmaceutical controlled substances for legitimate medical purposes. To accomplish those two goals, the statute creates two overlapping legal schemes. Registration provisions require entities working with controlled substances to register with DEA and implement various measures to prevent diversion and misuse of controlled substances. Trafficking provisions establish penalties for the production, distribution, and possession of controlled substances outside the legitimate scope of the registration system. DEA is primarily responsible for enforcing the registration provisions and works with the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice to enforce the trafficking provisions of the CSA. Violations of the registration provisions generally are not criminal offenses, but certain serious violations may result in criminal prosecutions, fines, and even short prison sentences. Violations of the trafficking provisions are criminal offenses that may result in large fines and lengthy prison sentences. Drug regulation has received significant attention from Congress in recent years, with a number of bills introduced in the 116th Congress that would amend the CSA in various ways. For example, after Congress passed several bills in recent years in response to the opioid crisis, additional proposals aimed at addressing the crisis are pending before the 116th Congress, including the John S. McCain Opioid Addiction Prevention Act (H.R. 1614, S. 724), which would limit practitioners' ability to prescribe opioids; the LABEL Opioids Act (H.R. 2732, S. 1449), which would require prescription opioids to bear certain warning labels; and the Ending the Fentanyl Crisis Act of 2019 (S. 1724), which would increase criminal liability for illicit trafficking in the powerful opioid fentanyl. The 116th Congress has also considered measures specifically seeking to address the proliferation of synthetic drugs that mimic the effects of fentanyl, including the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act (H.R. 2935, S. 1622) and the Modernizing Drug Enforcement Act of 2019 (H.R. 2580). In addition, multiple recent proposals would seek to address the divergence between federal and state marijuana laws. For example, the Secure And Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2019 (SAFE Banking Act) (H.R. 1595, S. 1200) would seek to protect depository institutions that provide financial services to cannabis-related businesses from regulatory sanctions, and the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (STATES Act) (H.R. 2093, S. 1028) would amend the CSA so that most provisions concerning marijuana do not apply to marijuana-related activities that comply with state law. Other proposals, such as the Legitimate Use of Medicinal Marihuana Act (H.R. 171) and the Marijuana Justice Act of 2019 (H.R. 1456, S. 597) could address the gap between federal and state law in the area of marijuana regulation by moving marijuana from Schedule I to a less restrictive schedule or remove marijuana from the CSA's schedules. Finally, recent legislative proposals would aim to facilitate clinical research involving controlled substances, particularly marijuana. These various proposals raise a number of legal questions as Congress contemplates whether to change the laws governing controlled substances. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Twitter has become an important venue for studying emerging patterns in health issues such as substance use because it can reflect trends in real-time and display messages generated directly by users, giving a uniquely personal voice to analyses. Over the past year, several states in the United States have passed legislation to legalize adult recreational use of cannabis and the federal government in Canada has done the same. There are few studies that examine the sentiment and content of tweets about cannabis since the recent legislative changes regarding cannabis have occurred in North America. Objective: To examine differences in the sentiment and content of cannabis-related tweets by state cannabis laws, and to examine differences in sentiment between the United States and Canada between 2017 and 2019. Methods: In total, 1,200,127 cannabis-related tweets were collected from January 1, 2017, to June 17, 2019, using the Twitter application programming interface. Tweets then were grouped geographically based on cannabis legal status (legal for adult recreational use, legal for medical use, and no legal use) in the locations from which the tweets came. Sentiment scoring for the tweets was done with VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), and differences in sentiment for states with different cannabis laws were tested using Tukey adjusted two-sided pairwise comparisons. Topic analysis to determine the content of tweets was done using latent Dirichlet allocation in Python, using a Java implementation, LdaMallet, with Gensim wrapper. Results: Significant differences were seen in tweet sentiment between US states with different cannabis laws (P=.001 for negative sentiment tweets in fully illegal compared to legal for adult recreational use states), as well as between the United States and Canada (P=.003 for positive sentiment and P=.001 for negative sentiment). In both cases, restrictive state policy environments (eg, those where cannabis use is fully illegal, or legal for medical use only) were associated with more negative tweet sentiment than less restrictive policy environments (eg, where cannabis is legal for adult recreational use). Six key topics were found in recent US tweet contents: fun and recreation (keywords, eg, love, life, high); daily life (today, start, live); transactions (buy, sell, money); places of use (room, car, house); medical use and cannabis industry (business, industry, company); and legalization (legalize, police, tax). The keywords representing content of tweets also differed between the United States and Canada. Conclusions: Knowledge about how cannabis is being discussed online, and geographic differences that exist in these conversations may help to inform public health planning and prevention efforts. Public health education about how to use cannabis in ways that promote safety and minimize harms may be especially important in places where cannabis is legal for adult recreational and medical use. ©Jenna van Draanen, HaoDong Tao, Saksham Gupta, Sam Liu.","","Cannabis; Communication; Geography; Humans; Social Media; United States; cannabis; geography; human; interpersonal communication; procedures; social media; United States","JMIR Publications Inc."

To increase understanding of these cannabis industry's efforts, this study describes cannabis industry campaign contributions in Colorado through an analysis of public records. Methods: We reviewed datasets posted online at the Colorado Secretary of State's Transparent in Contribution and Expenditure Reporting (TRACER) Campaign Finance System. We generated descriptive data on cannabis industry contributions to elections and conducted regressions to identify predictors of contributions, and associations between lagged contributions and a legislator's cannabis industry score (how closely aligned lawmaker's legislative history is with the cannabis industry from -1 to 1). Results: Between 2005-2021, 429 cannabis-affiliated contributors gave $4,658,385 (2021 inflation-adjusted) to 512 electoral committees. Contributions came primarily from non-profits (45%), businesses (27%), and individuals (25%). After recreational legalization in 2012, contributions from non-profit donors with industry ties gave way to contributions from cannabis businesses, business owners, and lobbyists. Cannabis industry contributions to local and state-wide ballot initiative campaigns historically made up the majority of the industry spending, but contributions to candidate committees more than tripled between the 2009-2010 legislative cycle and the 2019-2020 cycle. From 2017-2020, every $10,000 in lagged campaign donations from cannabis industry affiliated contributors was associated with a 0.245-point increase in a legislator's cannabis industry score (p=0.04). Conclusion: Cannabis-affiliated interests made substantial campaign contributions in Colorado. Public health advocates should monitor industry connections to lawmakers and industry tactics used to mask the source of political contributions. Continued surveillance of the cannabis industry is essential to exposing conflicts of interest and preventing undue industry influence. © 2023 The Author(s)","Cannabis; Colorado; Conflict of Interest; Politics; Public Health","Cannabis; Colorado; Health Expenditures; Humans; Industry; Surveys and Questionnaires; cannabis; Article; canabis industry; Colorado; controlled study; human; industry; inflation (economics); legal aspect; organizational policy; outcome assessment; policy; politics; public expenditure; public health campaign; public policy; recreational drug use; retrospective study; health care cost; industry; questionnaire","Elsevier B.V."

Using a content analysis methodology, the genres, the sources used, the dominant thematic areas are identified and the treatment given by the Spanish digital newspapers El País, El Mundo, ABC and La Razón, from January 1 to December 31, 2019, is compared. The findings show a predominance of informative texts, signed by the editors or the newspaper itself and a use of official sources. Regarding their subject matter, the newspapers continue to relate cannabis to actions typified as crimes (arrests, dismantling and seizures). Likewise, they incorporate new contents related to this substance, such as the business of production, distribution, biotechnology, cosmetics and leisure companies, which appear as an emerging sector. It also highlights the absence of information on programs, services and campaigns carried out by Institutions and other organizations to face problems of dependency or addiction, among others. These results suggest that legislative changes show the need to carry out a process of normalization of the status of cannabis, which tends to relate it to health, personal care, leisure and even luxury. Thus, Spanish newspapers are beginning to move away from the perception of cannabis as an illegal drug that has been maintained for decades, to show a somewhat more permissive image of cannabis, ignoring other aspects. © 2022 University of Piura.

Given the proliferation of cannabis outlets and their potential for impact on local economies, neighborhood structures, and individual patterns of cannabis use, it is essential to create practical and thorough methods to capture the location of such outlets for research purposes. However, methods used by researchers vary greatly between studies and often do not include important information about the retailer's license status and storefront signage. Objective: The aim of this study was to find methods for locating and observing cannabis outlets in Los Angeles County after the period when recreational cannabis retailers were granted licenses and allowed to be open for business. Methods: The procedures included searches of online cannabis outlet databases, followed by methods to verify each outlet's name, address, license information, and open status. These procedures, conducted solely online, resulted in a database of 531 outlets. To further verify each outlet's information and collect signage data, we conducted direct observations of the 531 identified outlets. Results: We found that 80.9% (430/531) of these outlets were open for business, of which 37.6% (162/430) were licensed to sell cannabis. Unlicensed outlets were less likely to have signage indicating the store sold cannabis, such as a green cross, which was the most prevalent form of observed signage. Co-use of cannabis and tobacco/nicotine has been found to be a substantial health concern, and we observed that 40.6% (175/430) of cannabis outlets had a tobacco/nicotine outlet within sight of the cannabis outlet. Most (350/430, 81.4%) cannabis outlets were located within the City of Los Angeles, and these outlets were more likely to be licensed than outlets outside the city. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that online searches and observational methods are both necessary to best capture accurate and detailed information about cannabis outlets. The methods described here can be applied to other metropolitan areas to more accurately capture the availability of cannabis in an area. © Eric R R Pedersen, Caislin Firth, Jennifer Parker, Regina A Shih, Steven Davenport, Anthony Rodriguez, Michael S Dunbar, Lisa Kraus, Joan S Tucker, Elizabeth J D'Amico.

Maylon. In Big Deal: The Politics of the Illicit Drug Business, the Cannabis Commodity Market, pp. 63-107. Guernsey, London.). Because of its importance, there has been an increasing number of investigations of the chemical, botanical, pharmacological, clinical and sociological aspects of the marijuana (hashish) problem. Since analytical techniques have improved substantially during the last 10 years, many papers have been published containing a variety of methods for detection and quantification of cannabis constituents. Since the analytical situation is becoming increasingly confused and because many of the journals are unavailable in less developed countries, the aim of this paper is to give an overview of existing analytical techniques and to attempt to distinguish practical and effective methods from those which are complex or which provide questionable results. © 1986.","","Cannabinoids; Cannabis; Chemistry; Methods; Tetrahydrocannabinol; cannabidiol; cannabinoid; cannabinol; cannabis; dronabinol; cannabivarin; drug analysis; drug determination; forensic medicine; gas liquid chromatography; high performance liquid chromatography; higher plant; methodology; nonhuman; radioimmunoassay; review; short survey; thin layer chromatography; ultraviolet spectrophotometry",""

This study investigated how the market functions by interviewing 267 imprisoned burglars. It found that burglars used an average of four different methods of disposal. The most common was trading stolen goods directly for drugs - mainly heroin in adults and cannabis in juveniles. Other methods included selling to family/friends, fences, legitimate businesses, pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers. Disposal of stolen goods appeared efficient, profitable and low risk. Many goods were stolen on commission and disposed of quickly, often in under one hour from the burglary. Burglars obtained between 25-33 per cent of the new price for certain stolen goods, earned a median income of AUS$2,000 per week and gave little thought to being caught. Receivers stood to make considerable profits and were also unlikely to be apprehended. The implications of these data for controlling the flow of stolen goods are discussed.","","",""
